Due to my fault, the workstation now is refusing to conect temporarily. Causing I get some time and finally make up my mind to write something to record My first study. I dont know how I will feel and what I can get when time passes and I look back to this blog(I believe I even wont look back :expressionless: ), But I just want to record something and give myself a chance to look back.

## 1. Determine the Study Direction

Since about Noc. 2020, me, a senior of mine, and my supervisor Mr.W had decided to do a new study together. which I long for a long time.(Its quite not easy for a undergraduate to do study in [my school]^(A Poor Ranking 211), lack of time, lack of advising, few of schoolmate did before, etc.)

Mr.M is a very responsible and enlightened supervisor, even pay more attention to undergraduate than his postgraduate. He found three junior student and held a class to teach them basic knowledge of machine learning and nlp last summer vacation. Luckily, I was one of them.

We decided the direction of study is adversary attack of natural language, which the senior and Mr.M did research before. Determined the direction is not easy, I watched the newest academic conferences of BDD and other international conferences, try to get some idea from the studys of expert. But every time I got some idea I believe is great, I found somebody had did it years ago. :unamused: At last, I realized I was unable to get an amazing idea and no one did before, so I just followed the idea given by Mr.W. (Btw, although I think I was more interested in CV before, it did not mean I didn't like NLP.) 

After determined the general direction, we started reading papers and keep meeting twice a week to discuss ideas. It was my first time reading plenty of papers in English intensively, make it a quite unique experience and I didn't feel any unfit at beginning. After about three weeks reading, we found a paper we think worth to follow and published its codes in github. So we began to follow its direction and try to improve it.

## 2. Reproduce the Code
